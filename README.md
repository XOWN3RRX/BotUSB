# BotUSB

This repository is created to be able to create automated applications (bot) that simulate at hardware level the press of a key or a mouse click.

This requires a special stick through which the data is sent.

If errors occur when you run the application and the error specifies that there is no HHID.dll file, copy the file from the _DLL folder to the bin/debug folder
